// This package contains native Win32 constants. All constants have their own
// type, in order to avoid improper mixing.
//
// They are named as close as possible to the original C/C++ declarations, so
// you can use the abundant online documentation. In addition to that, each
// entity has a link to its [official docs], so you can lookup the correct
// usage.
